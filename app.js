Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another.

Exercise 10
Create a method called `catchPokemon` and add it to the `game` object. You should not need to edit the original game object directly. This method should:
  - Accept an object as a parameter called `pokemonObj`
  - Add the `pokemonObj` to the `game.party` array.
  - not return anything

After writing this method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Exercise 11
1. Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. Modify it so that it also decreases the number of pokeballs in your inventory each time you catch a Pokémon.
2. How will you find and update the quantity of pokeballs in the `game.items` array?

Tips:
For this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.
After updating the method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.
